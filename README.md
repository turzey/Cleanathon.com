Climathon: https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/solutions/mitigation-of-the-illegal-dumping-sites

CLEANanthon team, decided to tackle this issue since citizens tend to dump various waste in illegal places around the city. Therefore, there is a problem regarding pollution, contamination, odor, unused materials that they could be re-cycled (circular economy). The idea is to use nudging by placing bins or other methods with informative logos in the illegal dumping areas so citizens will be indirectly educated and separate the waste even in these areas. Therefore, the materials will be provided to the stakeholders involved as a valuable product. This solution will mitigate the waste with the potential to either establish a waste collection spot or completely remove it depending on the needs of the area. Additionally, the illegal areas will be mapped in order to place them in collection routes and software such as apps will be used to inform and monitor the accumulation of waste.
